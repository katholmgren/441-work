# HW-10 Response

[HW-10 Live Link](https://katholmgren.github.io/441-work/HW-10)

For this week's homework, we worked with the HTML5 canvas and object collisions. Understanding collisions was a challenge for me, but I eventually got it working. For the creative part, I had grown attached to the squares so I decided to keep them and just add a background image. It's simple, but I like it. It ended up kind of abstract.

### Process

1. Set up files
2. Draw squares
3. Make blue square user-controlled
4. Make green square move freely
5. Add border restraints
6. Add sound
6. Struggle with collisions for a hot minute
7. Sweet victory over collisions
8. Add background image

### Difficulties

The collision part was hard to understand! I couldn't get it working with the code from the classwork, but I found a helpful example online at [developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/2D_collision_detection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/2D_collision_detection) and got it working after a while.

Another resource I used for the canvas border restraints was  [www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/bouncing-a-ball-around-with-html5-and-javascript/](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/bouncing-a-ball-around-with-html5-and-javascript/).
