# HW-5 Response

[HW-5 Live Link](https://katholmgren.github.io/441-work/HW-5)

For this week's homework, we started to make a matching game based on a grid. For me, the majority of the work was planning an aesthetic, and drawing and editing the photos. I enjoyed this process and am satisfied with how the images look together. As for the coding, I was able to adapt the example to match how I wanted the web page to look. This was straightforward, and I plan on looking at the code again tonight to make sure I understand everything.

### Process

1. Draw and edit images
2. Edit the class example
3. Trouble with gitHub Desktop
4. Study code in depth

### Difficulties

It was nice having an easier assignment this week for the three day weekend. I understand this week's course material, but not in application so I will be studying the homework tonight. Most of difficulites are with gitHub desktop. I'm getting the following error that won't let me push my work to github.com.
