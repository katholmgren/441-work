# HW-12 Response

For this week's homework, we learned about the library Phaser and altered a platformer game example from class. I altered the game by adding levels, using the space bar, adding spikes, changing the theme, and adding another platform. I enjoyed learning about Phaser this week. It's more intuitive than making everything by using JavaScript. I see a lot of potential for it.

### Process

1. Download assets and follow the example
2. Add another platform
3. Change Up to space bar
4. Add level counter
5. Replace assets
6. Add spikes and collisions

### Difficulties

I tried changing the player sprite a couple of times with two different sprite sheets from the assets folder. But I either got errors or the entire sprite sheet would display on the screen. I wasn't sure how to fix this. But it's funny that the onion collectibles match the dude's head now.
