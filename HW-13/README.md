# HW-13 Response

[HW-13 Live Link](https://katholmgren.github.io/441-work/HW-13)

This week we used three.js to experiment with working in 3d. This was new to me, so there was a lot of guess-and-check and googling this week. I ran into many issues, but now I have a basic understanding of what three.js can do. Because I'm not in the BFA, I've never used Maya or have made a model before.

### Process

1. Add a cube
2. Add a cone
3. Add rotation
4. Research mouse controls
5. Work with First Person Controls...
5. Work with Trackball Controls
6. Disable animated rotation
7. Tried to separate the cube and cone
8. Tried to add a background image
9. Tried to add a border to the shapes

### Difficulties

There were many things in three.js I didn't understand. Even simple things like adding a border to the shapes, repositioning the shapes, or adding a background image were more complicated than I expected them to be. I'm glad I got the shapes to rotate with the mouse, but I wish I had understood Three better so I could have made something more than a cube and a cone overlapping. I see the potential, though.
