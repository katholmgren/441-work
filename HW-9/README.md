# HW-9 Response

[HW-9 Live Link](https://katholmgren.github.io/441-work/HW-9)

For this week's homework we were supposed to use json, ajax, and JQuery to display a data list. I had a hard time understanding how these worked together. I decided to use the Nobel Peace Prize data list.

### Process

1. Set up file structure
2. Find a data list
3. Watch example video
4. Analyze and alter example code
5. Start over
6. Basic index.html and stylesheet
7. Make JSON object
8. Try to get JSON to display
9. Spend a lot of time fixing syntax errors
10. Troubleshooting
11. Out of time

### Difficulties

I had difficulty getting the JSON data to display, which was the core of the assignment. I got it working just 45 minutes before the deadline, so I didn't have time to be artistic with it. If I was to continue, I would like to add the entire json data sheet so I could retrieve a random Nobel Peace Prize winner every time. Then I would use JQuery to display the information in a more creative way.
